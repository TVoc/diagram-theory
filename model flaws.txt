Bad things to find:

- whole diagram consistency
  --> finite satisfiability problems ( https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~cd-patterns/?page_id=1678 )
- class without associations
(- attribute that is not a basic type)
- non-binary associations
- Many-to-many associations
- in a hierarchy: more relaxed multiplicity constraints further down the hierarchy
- class subsumption/equivalence
- equivalent classes ( https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~cd-patterns/?page_id=497 )
    -> one-to-one association between superclass and subclass
- redundant hierarchy ( https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~cd-patterns/?page_id=1545 )
- blob/god object: https://sourcemaking.com/antipatterns/the-blob
- functional decomposition: class designed to perform a simple function â€” few methods, but a large amount of variables

- poltergeist: Class whose only functionality is to start a process (relevant to both class diagrams and sequence diagrams)
